# Simple Flake8 linter package

Find and display flake8 linting errors using `cmd-shift-8`(OSX) or `ctrl-shift-8`(Linux/Wndows) in Atom.

This package is inspired by the command pallet (https://github.com/atom/command-palette)
and used it as the starting point for its codebase.

Other inspiration has come from Atoms Flake 8 linter plugin (https://github.com/julozi/atom-flake8)
